Skydive Madrid
Madrid, Spain
Like: 
- Almost always sunny! Jumping all day round, and usually you only have to wait a couple of loads until you can go up again.
- Small DZ where people know each other well. Makes for chill vibes once the final load has landed and you crack open some beers to watch the last part of sunset.
Dislike:
- Shop prices were a bit too high to be reasonable
- Despite having Madrid in the name, you can barely see Madrid from the sky!
- Surrounding landscape is a bit dry and brown
- Landing area outside of the astroturf is hardened mud - if you have a bad landing, it hurts!

Include my own pictures
Ability level for jumping heavily depends on windspeed.
Located on the outskirts of Madrid

GoSkydive
Sailsbury, England
Like:
- You can see stonehenge once under canopy! How cool is that!
- There are some incredibly experienced instructors working there (as of 2020) that are amazing to learn new skills from!
- Next to an aviation museum with a wealth of history inside of it, that's free to enter as a customer of goskydive, and cheap for all other visitors.
  If you like planes, then you'll have an amazing time looking around the mueseum. In fact, the dropzone itself was used during WW2 (CHECK INFO)
Dislike:
- In our opinion, this DZ was poorly organised and extremley money-oriented
Location tag: <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2505.335006154199!2d-1.781935284761335!3d51.10227894806426!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x4873eeb44e2850a1%3A0xeee833e5e915ba2f!2sGoSkydive!5e0!3m2!1sen!2suk!4v1673877469446!5m2!1sen!2suk" width="600" height="450" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>

Since the summer of 2021 it appears that the DZ have stopped offering standard jump tickets to skydivers, and instead focus primarily on tandem skydives.
However, if you know the DZ from during the time they ran an AFF course, we belive that it is a possibility you can continue jumping with just an A Licence
by getting in contact with the company.

In 2021, a jump ticket cost Â£25 and gear rental was temporarily free.





SkyHigh Skydiving
Durham, England
Like:
- For starters, it's super near Durham, which means Durham Uni students can go skydiving on the weekends whenever they want - result!
Dislike: 
- Currently only open Friday to Sunday; what if I have a day off during the week and want to jump!? I can't. Noooooooo!!





Skydive Belize
We normally only talk about solo / team jumps on this website, but we've decided to make an exception with skydive Belize. Although they have in the past ran an annual boogie, we are unsure as to whether it is currently running.
Instead we want to talk about their package detail, which we are sure that all of our adrenaline-seeking readers out there will love the sound of.
Like: 
- This is one of the most desirable jumps in the world to make. Looking down from the plane into the deep blue abyss that is the blue hole is sure to make your jaw drop on your heart sing. How beautiful would that be!?
- You can jump in flip flops and swim shorts if you like - sound pretty liberating to us!
- Once you get picked up by the rescue boat, it takes you straight onto a scuba diving session in the blue hole! How freaking awesome would that be!?
Dislike: 
- Jumping into the blue hole requires you to perform a water landing. Whilst this is safe enough, with boats on hand ready to pick you up straight after you land in the water, there's a problem.
	Salt water. Salt water is not at all healthy for your skydiving gear, so after just a few jumps you may need to replace your multi-thousand pound 'chute; no thanks!
- We mentioned liking that you can jump in flip flops, but the downside to that point is that safety regulations might not be *quite* the same as in Europe - so make sure you know your gear is in tip top condition before you consider jumping here!
- The price is absolutely eye watering. Understandbly, maybe, because the logistics, permits and equipment involved in this adventure of a lifetime are incredibly expensive for the company, but even so, if this jump is now on your bucket list then
	start saving now!

Skydive Mexico

Skydive Maldives
Maldives
Like:
- THE VIEW!!! LOOK AT THAT VIEW!
- The landing area is the beach - why not swoop down onto the sand and grab a beer from your buddies hand before you hit the ground ;)
- There's plenty of other activities to do outside of skydiving. Why not go scuba diving with sharks, or get your tan going on the beaches? You're in the maldives after all!
Dislike:
- 200 skydives is a pretty high jump; this place is only for the experienced
- Expensive. The dropzone and the surrounding area will burn a whole in all but the most wealthy skydivers out there :/
