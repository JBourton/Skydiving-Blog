With thanks to https://www.happyhues.co/palettes/11 for the colour scheme inspiration

- For the background I will be using #f9f4ef
- For the main block of the website (that displays the dropzone) I will be using #fffffe
- For the Likes and Dislikes labels, I could get rid of the images and change the font to a spaced cursive font in all caps
	These could then be in the dark #8c7851 colour.
	Alternativley, likes and dislikes could be in the highlight #f25042 colour and all other subheadings could be in the highlight font #8c7851
- Buttons can be in the same #8c7851 colour
- Text can be in #eaddcf


The red would like nice complementing the title of the webpage. Anything important can be with red added in.
White can be used only for the DZ box. The border of the box can be a few pixels thick with #020826

So headings and title in the highlight colour, text in the secondary colour
Main background and DZ box background decided.

Button colour subtly different to other colours but fits in with colour scheme well.

A (non-copyrighted) image of the sun would complement the title.
