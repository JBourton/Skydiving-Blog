This repository will contain my work on the programming black coursework on web development and client-server interaction.

__Website theme__
This website will be on the theme of sport skydiving, specifically cool places around the world where you can participate in it.

The website will provide information about a handful of different dropzones in a humorous, light-hearted style. 

Users of the website will be able to comment on their experience at these dropzones. The idea is to create the begginings of a community on which advice is traded and meetups are arranged between fellow skydivers.
