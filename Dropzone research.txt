Skydive Madrid
Madrid, Spain
Like: 
- Almost always sunny! Jumping all day round, and usually you only have to wait a couple of loads until you can go up again.
- Small DZ where people know each other well. Makes for chill vibes once the final load has landed and you crack open some beers to watch the last part of sunset.
Dislike:
- Shop prices were a bit too high to be reasonable
- Despite having Madrid in the name, you can barely see Madrid from the sky!
- Surrounding landscape is a bit dry and brown
- Landing area outside of the astroturf is hardened mud - if you have a bad landing, it hurts!

Include my own pictures
Ability level for jumping heavily depends on windspeed.
Located on the outskirts of Madrid

GoSkydive
Sailsbury, England
Like:
- You can see stonehenge once under canopy! How cool is that!
- There are some incredibly experienced instructors working there (as of 2020) that are amazing to learn new skills from!
- Next to an aviation museum with a wealth of history inside of it, that's free to enter as a customer of goskydive, and cheap for all other visitors.
  If you like planes, then you'll have an amazing time looking around the mueseum. In fact, the dropzone itself was used during WW2 (CHECK INFO)
Dislike:
- In our opinion, this DZ was poorly organised and extremley money-oriented

Since the summer of 2021 it appears that the DZ have stopped offering standard jump tickets to skydivers, and instead focus primarily on tandem skydives.
However, if you know the DZ from during the time they ran an AFF course, we belive that it is a possibility you can continue jumping with just an A Licence
by getting in contact with the company.

In 2021, a jump ticket cost Â£25 and gear rental was temporarily free.

SkyHigh Skydiving
Durham, England
Like:
- For starters, it's super near Durham, which means Durham Uni students can go skydiving on the weekends whenever they want - result!
Dislike: 
- Currently only open Friday to Sunday; what if I have a day off during the week and want to jump!? I can't. Noooooooo!!

Skydive Maldives
Maldives
Like:
- THE VIEW!!! LOOK AT THAT VIEW!
- The landing area is the beach - why not swoop down onto the sand and grab a beer from your buddies hand before you hit the ground ;)
- There's plenty of other activities to do outside of skydiving. Why not go scuba diving with sharks, or get your tan going on the beaches? You're in the maldives after all!
Dislike:
- 200 skydives is a pretty high jump; this place is only for the experienced
- Expensive. The dropzone and the surrounding area will burn a whole in all but the most wealthy skydivers out there :/
