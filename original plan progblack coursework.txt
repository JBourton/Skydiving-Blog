Rough overview of website
- A website about skydiving
- This website can detail some of the coolest dropzones in the world and up and coming events at those DZs
- There is a possiblity that I could sync data from a live, running event calendar for real life events
- Could possibly have profiles w/ username & password but I'd rather not
- To extend that, could have access privilleges based on level of skydiver, but again, maybe not
- For each event / dropzone, users should be able to comment on the picture, either under a chosen username or on their account
- Can have more than one page, so should have a 'pro-skydivers' page where experienced skydivers can change certain things about the webpage, such as event dates/locations
- Could have a sign-up lists for events where users can add their names to the list (check for duplicates); can use createElement (example found here: https://durham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=47570d16-f571-4c0c-8544-af43009558c9)


Technical details
- Will make use of bootstrap as a front-end framework
- Will need to ensure that ratios are used instead of pixels for images, for responsiveness on different devices (note: using bootstrap will help ensure this)
