<ul><li>Almost always sunny! Jumping all day round, and usually you only have to wait a couple of loads until you can go up again.</li><li>Small DZ where people know each other well. Makes for chill vibes once the final load has landed and you crack open some beers to watch the last part of sunset.</li><li>They make some banging bocadillos in the kitchen (obviously important if you've got your priorities straight)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Shop prices were a bit too high to be reasonable</li><li>Despite having Madrid in the name, you can barely see Madrid from the sky! So don't expect a sweeping view of the city as you climb to altitude, because you won't get it :/</li><li>Surrounding landscape is a bit dry and brown</li><li>Landing area outside of the astroturf is hardened mud - if you have a bad landing, it hurts!</li></ul>

<ul><li>You can see stonehenge once under canopy! How cool is that!<li>There are some incredibly experienced instructors working there (as of 2020) that are amazing to learn new skills from!</li><li>Next to an aviation museum with a wealth of history inside of it, that's free to enter as a customer of goskydive, and cheap for all other visitors. If you like planes, then you'll have an amazing time looking around the mueseum. In fact, the dropzone itself was used during WW2 for some critically important missions, which you can learn about on-site.</li><li>The surrounding area of Old Sarum is rich in English heritige, which you can explore after your skydive at your leisure. If you're interested in finding out more about Old Sarum, here's an interesting website: https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/old-sarum/history/</li></ul>
<ul><li>In our opinion, this DZ was poorly organised and extremley money-oriented</li><li>It's also very tandem-focused, so change your expectations if you're expecting to be given lots of attention and space throughout the day as a fun jumper."</li></ul>

<ul><li>This is one of the most desirable jumps in the world to make. Looking down from the plane into the deep blue abyss that is the blue hole is sure to make your jaw drop on your heart sing. How beautiful would that be!?</li><li>You can jump in flip flops and swim shorts if you like - sound pretty liberating to us!</li><li>Once you get picked up by the rescue boat, it takes you straight onto a scuba diving session in the blue hole! How freaking awesome would that be!?</li></ul>
<ul><li>Jumping into the blue hole requires you to perform a water landing. Whilst this is safe enough, with boats on hand ready to pick you up straight after you land in the water, there's a problem.</li><li>Salt water. Salt water is not at all healthy for your skydiving gear, so after just a few jumps you may need to replace your multi-thousand pound 'chute; no thanks!</li><li>mentioned liking that you can jump in flip flops, but the downside to that point is that safety regulations might not be *quite* the same as in Europe - so make sure you know your gear is in tip top condition before you consider jumping here!</li><li>The price is enough to make you want to cry. Understandbly, maybe, because the logistics, equipment and permits (*COUGH*COUGH*bribes*COUGH) involved in this adventure of a lifetime are incredibly expensive for the company, but even so, if this jump is now on your bucket list then start saving now!</li></ul>
